      "message": "I agree with this \"should\". However I\u0027m not sure this is the fine place to do that. There is different things we should check in a \"check_sanity()\" function, like for example:\n\n- ensure there is super admin users\n- ensure there is an admin team\n- ensure we can create files in Swift and on the file system\n- ensure ES is up to date and running\n- etc\n\nI would prefer we handle these cases and create a story for that.",
