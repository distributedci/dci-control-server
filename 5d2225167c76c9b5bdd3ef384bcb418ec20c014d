      "message": "Having columns without usage will lead to misunderstanding and confusions. Every time I read the database for further development I have to remind myself which field is used for what. Before this patch when doing this on those columns the answer was: NOTHING. Ok, so when I develop I have to remind myself if it is used or not, this is not expressive at all. If something is present it has a usage (and by usage I mean now, not in a use case which does not exists at that time in the application).",
