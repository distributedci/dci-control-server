      "message": "If user\u003dNone, we drop the partitioned view. I\u0027ve the feeling this can be abused at some point to gain extra privilege. There is no way to know if a value is None on purpose, or if it\u0027s because of a bug.\n\nI would prefer to either:\n\n- we raise an error before if user is not defined\n- adjust is_admin() so it will return None if user is not defined. We should have a KeyError exception for the moment.\n\nupdate: I just saw you additional change, I think it\u0027s easier to have a generic \u0027public\u0027 user here.",
